# FA Training

This is a semester-long assignment created for the VR for the Social Good class and the University of Florida. Our group, TBA VR, designed this project, in collaboration with BehaviorMe, Inc. as a tool for behavioral therapists to learn how to interact with children with autism. Following BehaviorMe's design choices, we created this game using the Unity game engine, for the Oculus Rift VR Headset. The game involves learning how to probe a patient to have a tantrum, and then figuring out what needs to be done in order to stop the tantrum. Players interact with the game environment using the Oculus Rift Touch controllers.

### Prerequisites

In order to test this project, you will need an Oculus Rift headset with Touch Controls, and a Windows PC that can support Oculus. Ensure that your Oculus environment is already set up before downloading and installing this game.

### Installing Demo

After opening the directory, navigate to the "Demo" folder.

Once inside this folder, double-click on the "FA Training" application to start the game.

Use the control stick on your left Oculus controller to navigate the menus, and use the A button on the right controller to select any menu buttons.
