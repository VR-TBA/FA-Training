# FA Training

This project was created in collaboration with BehaviorMe, Inc. as a tool for behavioral therapists to learn how to interact with children with autism. Following BehaviorMe's design choices, we created this game using the Unity game engine, for the Oculus Rift VR Headset. The game involves learning how to probe a patient to have a tantrum, and then figuring out what needs to be done in order to stop the tantrum. Players interact with the game environment using the Oculus Rift Touch controllers.

### Prerequisites
